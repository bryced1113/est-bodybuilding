### "Design looks different than the screenshots"
**Solution:** Reference the screenshots and specs document. Request revisions until it matches.

### "Mobile version doesn't look right"
**Solution:** Review the mobile screenshot references provided. Ensure developer tests on real devices.

### "Can't create the sharp dumbbell icon"
**Solution:** Provide them the DumbbellIcon.jsx file - it has the exact SVG code they need to recreate.

### "Need more information about [X]"
**Solution:** Check EST_BODYBUILDING_SHOPIFY_SPECS.md first - it's very comprehensive. If still unclear, have developer reach out with specific questions.
