## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES FOR YOUR DEVELOPER

### 1. Icon Design:
The dumbbell icon MUST be sharp and angular - NOT the rounded Lucide icon. It should look like:
```
[===]—————[===]
```
Not bubbly or rounded. Think: metal, strength, geometric.

### 2. Custom Photos Pending:
Currently using placeholder images. Client will provide custom product photos in a few days. Developer should make it easy to swap images when ready.

### 3. Size Variants:
Only offer M, L, XL, XXL (no Small size). Ensure size selector is prominent and easy to use.

### 4. Mobile Priority:
Test extensively on mobile. Many customers will shop from phones.

### 5. Black & White Only:
Stick to the monochrome palette. No color accents unless specifically requested.
